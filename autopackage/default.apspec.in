[Description]
Xara LX is primarily a vector graphics (drawing and illustration) program but is
one of the new generation of cross-over products that handles photos and
drawings with equal ease. See xaralx.org for details. Xara LX is currently
incomplete as it is an ongoing port to Linux of the finished product Xara Xtreme
(see www.xara.com/xtreme).
