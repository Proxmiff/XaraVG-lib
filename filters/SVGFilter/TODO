*** C++ ***

* follow Xara C++ style conventions for indenting and commenting
* add proper comments
* the error handling is non-existent (exceptions?)
* generate XAR tags for objects/groups labels (id and xml:id properties)
* review the tree of #include's and remove useless ones

*** SVG ***

* fill-rule fill property
* stroke-linecap, stroke-linejoin, stroke-miterlimit, stroke-dasharray, stroke-dashoffset
* solidColor in <defs>
* gradient radial fill
* handle <defs> in the correct way: each one should have its own hashtable and
  the filter should handle objects defined there and referenced later with <use />
* parse <style type="text/css"> section
* bitmaps
* texts

*** Known Bugs ***

1) tests/rects_trans.svg test fails:

The entities

  <rect x="30cm" y="2cm" width="600" height="300" transform="translate(50, 50) scale(.5, .5)"
    style="fill:red; stroke:blue; stroke-width:3"/>
  <rect x="15cm" y="2cm" width="1cm" height="3cm" transform="translate(-10, 20) scale(1.25, 1.5)"
    style="fill:yellow; stroke:black; stroke-width:3"/>

are not handled correctly.

2) There are some bugs in transformations, "people_juliane_krug_04a.svg" from
openclipart.org has objects moved in the wrong position.
Also "tests/inkscape_tiger.svg" is positioned in wrong area.

3) Some SVG files have geometry not correctly imported, some have improper width,
height, viewBox properties that confuse the filter.

Examples:
    tests/inkscape2.svg

4) Transparent objects (opacity < 1.0) do not look the same as in Inkscape or Firefox.
TAG_FLATTRANSPARENTFILL with flag 0x01 is not enough.
